\section{Cost of Transformative Write IO}

Transforming write IO has space and read overheads. In PLFS, this is a problem
because index files need to be coalesced on reads.  Patterned
PLFS~\cite{he:hpdc13-plfs-patterns} reduces the space overheads by storing
formulas, instead of index files, to represent write behavior. Diddlings
~\cite{grider:pc17-diddlings} transfers index files after each write to absorb
the transfer overheads up front. While these approaches help alleviate read
overheads, they do not reduce the file system metadata load, which is the real
problem.

Reading the index file still requires a file system metadata operation. To
demonstrate the load this generates on the underlying file system
