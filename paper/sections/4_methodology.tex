\section{Methodology}

In this section, we show how clients and metadata servers communicate using the
Pattern PLFS language and present our
storage system that adapts to the wokload
(Section~\ref{sec:adapting-to-the-workload-with-cudele})).  Other destructive
solutions include changing the storage system and altering the application.

\subsection{Adapting to the Workload with Cudele}
\label{sec:adapting-to-the-workload-with-cudele}

  system about the workload. Clients can specify a Structured Namespace (blue
  subtrees and Section~\ref{sec:structured-namespaces}) or by merging file system
  metadata from an Unstructured Namespace (red subtree and
  Section~\ref{sec:unstructured-namespaces}).}\label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}

% What is Cudele
Cudele is a file system with programmable consistency and durability. Clients
use an API to decouple existing subtrees from the global namespace; metadata
operations from the other clients targeted at the decoupled subtree can be
programmed to be blocked or marked as overwritable. With the decoupled subtree
in hand, the client can do metadata operations locally. Upon completion, the
client can merge the subtree back into the global namespace. 

% Why Cudele is a good fit for implied namespaces
Cudele has the mechanisms for understanding the file system metadata language
and adapting to the workload.  Figure~\ref{fig:arch} shows how clients decouple
the namespace with the Cudele API, specifying how many extra inodes they want
and the structure for the namespace they intend to create. The metadata server
and client both know about the metadata in the blue subtree, requiring no RPCs,
and if the client creates more metadata (red subtree), it can merge it back
into the global namespace.  This model lets users enjoy the simplicity of
global namespaces and the high performance of node-local operations.  We extend
the API to support the declaration of structured namespaces and leverage the
existing API to merge unstructured namespaces. 

\subsubsection{Structured Namespaces}
\label{sec:structured-namespaces}

% What is a structured namespace
A structured namespace is created according to a pattern. If both the client
and metadata server knows the pattern, they can create the metadata
independently. This has two benefits: (1) it reduces RPCs which improves
performance and reduces network traffic and (2) it allows the client and server
to operate in parallel.  The patterns that Cudele understands are shown in
Listing~\ref{src:example} and the programmable interfaces are shown below.
There are two parameters for unstructured namespaces: \texttt{pattern} and
\texttt{trigger}. 

\subsubsection{Trigger: Start Namespace Construction}

% How does trigger work and why do we neet it
\texttt{trigger} specifies when to start the namespace construction on the
metadata server.  The metadata reconstruction can be asynchronous and saving
this resource intense process for later can have better performance. To
facilitate the exploration of different trigger policies, we make the value for
the \texttt{trigger} parameter programmable.  Administrators inject Lua code
that specifies or calculates thresholds for when to start namespace
construction. Although we make this programmable, we do not make any
conclusions about the best trigger time and leave the exploration of this space
as future work.

% example
In Listing~\ref{src:example}, the trigger is:
\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}[frame=single,
               framesep=2mm,
               xleftmargin=10pt,
               tabsize=2]{lua}
{
  if MDSs[whoami]["cpu"] > 30
}
\end{minted}
\label{src:thresh}
\end{listing}

which means that construction of the namespace will start if current MDS
(\texttt{whoami}) has a CPU utilization (\texttt{``cpu"}) above 30\%.

% Drawbacks: consistency
Triggering construction asynchronously can improve performance because the
process can be deferred until the system has less load. However, this
performance gain comes at the cost of consistency. Even if the construction is
triggered immediately, the metadata is eventually consistent; other clients see
outdated metadata because the namespace is sitting on the client. Delaying the
trigger improves the liklihood that system finds a window of low load but also
increases the latency of other clients.\\

\noindent\textbf{Implementation}: we re-use the polling and embedded Lua
virtual machine in Mantle~\cite{sevilla:sc15-mantle} to implement the trigger
interface. By default, every 10 seconds the metadata server checks if the
condition for triggering is satisfied by executing the Lua code. Mantle has
variables exposed for administrators to explore load balancing policies; just
like this work, some of these policies need to identify overloaded metadata
servers so we re-use all those variables.  Some of the more useful variables
include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Memory Usage
  \item CPU Utilization
  \item Request Rate
  \item Queue Depth
  \item Server Tags: whoami, i
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pattern: Express Namespace}
\label{sec:pattern-express-namespace}

% How does pattern work and why do we need it
\texttt{pattern} describes the metadata layout of the Structured Namespaces. It
is the same language used in~\cite{he:hpdc13-plfs-patterns}. When the metadata
server starts a namespace construction, it creates all the file system metadata
generated by this formula. As a refresher, the pattern in Listing~\ref{src:example}:

  \[[i, (d[0], d[1], ...)^r]\]

means that there are \(r\) entries in the PLFS index file, where the first
entry has a physical offset of \(i\) and lengths of \(d\), where the pattern in
\(d\) repeats. \\

% WTF -- this doesn't give file system metadata! ARGGGGG is it file creations
% or index files shit?

% Drawbacks

\noindent\textbf{Implementation}: Another big fat TODO.

\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}[frame=single,
               framesep=2mm,
               xleftmargin=10pt,
               tabsize=2]{js}
{
  <!-- Structured Namespace Pattern !-->
  "S_pattern": "[i, (d[0], d[1], ...)^r]",
  
  <!-- Structured Namespace Trigger !-->
  "S_trigger": "if MDSs[whoami]["cpu"] > 30",
  
  <!-- Untructured Namespace Allocated Inos !-->
  "US_alloci": "1000",
}
\end{minted}
